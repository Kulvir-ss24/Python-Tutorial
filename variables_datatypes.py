#What is variable?
# A variable is a name that refers to a value. it can change its value.
name="kulvir"
age=20
print(name,age)

#Now let's create another variable and store the existing variable
name2 = name
print(name2)  # This will print the value of name2, which is "kulvir"

#Rules for Identifiers commonly known as variable names and can be called as functions.
# 1. Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
# 2. Variable names cannot start with a number.
# 3. Identifiers can be the combination of uppercase and lowercase letters and can be of any length.
# For example, these are valid identifiers:
user_name = "Alice"
userAge = 25
_user_id = 12345
user123 = "Bob"

# 4. Identifiers cannot be a reserved keyword in Python (like 'if', 'else', 'while', etc.).
myVariable = 10  # Valid variable name
print_name = "Hello"  # Valid variable name
your_first_name = "Kulvir"  # Valid variable name

# 5. it cannot contain special characters like @, #, $, %, etc.
# Identifier cannot start with a digit. Some examples of invalid variable names:
# 1st_variable = 5  # Invalid variable name (starts with a digit)
# my-variable = 10  # Invalid variable name (contains a hyphen)
# my variable = 10  # Invalid variable name (contains a space)

# 6. Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning 'myVariable' and 'myvariable' are different variables.
MyVariable = 20  # Valid variable name, different from myVariable
variable_1 = 30  # Valid variable name
variable1= 40  # Valid variable name

# 7. Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful to improve code readability.
# For example, instead of using 'x' or 'y', use 'user_age' or 'product_price'.
user_age = 30  # Descriptive variable name
product_price = 19.99  # Descriptive variable name
print(user_age,product_price)
# 8. Variable names should be simple, short and meaningful.
